# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This project implements a logistic regression model from scratch to predict loan eligibility based on applicant information. 

The goal is to build a simple yet effective model without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, providing insights into the inner workings of logistic regression and gradient descent optimization.

The dataset I've used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan) - Loan_Data.csv file


The final output generates a CSV file (result_new.csv) with predictions made using logistic regression.
